# Ethereum UniversalLoginSDK

Ethereum UniversalLoginSDK is composed of smart contracts, a js lib, and a relayer that help build applications using ERC [#725](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-725.md), [#735](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/735), [#1077](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/1077) and [#1078](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/1078).

This is a work in progress. Expect breaking changes. The code has not been audited and therefore can not be considered secure.
Planned functionality for first release include:

- Creating and managing identities
- Multi-factor authentication
- Universal login
- Ether less transactions via relayer

### Structure
This repository is organised as monorepo.

- [Contracts](https://github.com/EthWorks/UniversalLoginSDK/tree/master/universal-login-contracts) - all contracts used in this project
- [Relayer](https://github.com/EthWorks/UniversalLoginSDK/blob/master/universal-login-relayer/README.md) - allows to interact with blockchain
- [SDK](https://github.com/EthWorks/UniversalLoginSDK/blob/master/universal-login-sdk/README.md) - easy way to communicate with relayer by http protocol
- [Example](https://github.com/EthWorks/UniversalLoginSDK/blob/master/universal-login-example/README.md) - example app, which shows how to use SDK
